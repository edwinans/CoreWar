What is Core War?

Core War (or Core Wars) is a programming game where assembly programs try to destroy each other in the memory of a simulated computer. The programs (or warriors) are written in a special language called Redcode, and run by a program called MARS (Memory Array Redcode Simulator).

Both Redcode and the MARS environment are much simplified and abstracted compared to ordinary computer systems. This is a good thing, since CW programs are written for performance, not for clarity. If the game used an ordinary assembly language, there might be two or three people in the world capable of writing an effective and durable warrior, and even they wouldn't probably be able to understand it fully. It would certainly be challenging and full of potential, but it'd probably take years to reach even a moderate level of skill.
